I've been studying Immersive Data Analytics. It's 5-weeks, it's accelerated, it's tough, and it's awesome!
For the last 6 months, I have been diligently studying for my CompTIA Network+ Certification. It too is arduous.
My goal is to become an AWS Certified SAA: an AWS Solutions Architect Associate.
